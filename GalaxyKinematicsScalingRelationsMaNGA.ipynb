    "Finally, we'll plot unique data - meaning the values which are independently measured. This isn't true if you plot data in every spaxel, for various reasons. Spaxels are actually smaller than the spatial resolution of the data (0.5\" compared to 2.5\") and the data are also often binned to improve the signal-noise ratio. A bin here is a collection of spatially adjacent spaxels. As the [Marvin DAP Tools Tutorial](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/manga/manga-tutorials/marvin-tutorial/marvin-tools) describes, the MaNGA spaxels are binned in various different ways. Use the code shown in the [Marvin DAP Tools Tutorial](https://www.sdss4.org/dr17/manga/manga-tutorials/marvin-tutorial/marvin-tools)to plot the velocity of unique stellar velocity bins in a scatter plot. **Make sure to use your galaxy, not the example in the tutorial - you have to change the ```plate-ifu=7443-12703``` in the code**"
