# ASTR352 Jupyter Activities
 Python (Jupyter) based activities used in ASTR352 (Extragalactic Data Science) 0.5 credit upper-level undergraduate class at Haverford College.

 These examples were practiced and/or developed in a [Sciserver.org](https://apps.sciserver.org/dashboard/) Compute Jupyter Notebook. 

 1. Computing Galactic Orbits of Stars with Gala [Astropy tutorial](https://learn.astropy.org/rst-tutorials/gaia-galactic-orbits.html) 

 2. Galaxy Populations and Data Visualisation - using SciServer and Casjobs to query SDSS data, learn about sample selection, data frames (pandas), and some examples of data visualisation with matplotlib.

 3. Marvin Access to MaNGA
   a. We will explore [SDSS-IV MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/dr16/manga/) spectral maps of galaxies with the code, Marvin
   b. Check out [Marvin Web](https://dr16.sdss.org/marvin/) and pick a galaxy you like. 
   c. Do the [Plotting Tutorial: The Basics of Plotting in Marvin](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/plotting-tutorial.html), and make the plots for your chosen galaxy. 
   d. Pick one of the [Science Exercises](https://sdss-marvin.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/exercises.html) to try out.
