# ASTR352 Jupyter Activities
 Python (Jupyter) based activities used in ASTR352 (Extragalactic Data Science) 0.5 credit upper-level undergraduate class at Haverford College.

 These examples were practiced and/or developed in a [Sciserver.org](https://apps.sciserver.org/dashboard/) Compute Jupyter Notebook. 

 1. Computing Galactic Orbits of Stars with Gala [Astropy tutorial](https://learn.astropy.org/rst-tutorials/gaia-galactic-orbits.html) 

 2. Galaxy Populations and Data Visualisation - using SciServer and Casjobs to query SDSS data, learn about sample selection, data frames (pandas), and some examples of data visualisation with matplotlib. 

 ## Other Resources 
Here are a bunch of links to other Astronomical Python Tutorials and/or Examples, some of which have been directly used in the development of materials for this class.
