# ASTR352 Jupyter Activities
 Python (Jupyter) based activities used in ASTR352 (Extragalactic Data Science) upper-level undergraduate class at Haverford College.

 These examples were practiced and/or developed in a Sciserver.org Compute Jupyter Notebook. 

 1. Computing Galactic Orbits of Stars with Gala [Astropy tutorial](https://learn.astropy.org/rst-tutorials/gaia-galactic-orbits.html) 

 2. Galaxy Populations and Data Visualisation - using SciServer and Casjobs to query SDSS data, learn about sample selection, data frames (pandas), and some examples of data visualisation with matplotlib.
